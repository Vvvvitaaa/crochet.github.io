                    <br>Crochet is a type of needlework in which you use a hook to create fabric from loops of yarn. No one is quite sure when and where crochet got its start, but it is believed to have originated in either Arabia or China. The type of crochet we know today spread to Europe in the 1800s, and has been growing in popularity ever since!
                    <br> Crochet is a craft technique that involves using a hooked needle to create fabric by interlocking loops of yarn or thread. It is similar to knitting, but instead of using two needles, crochet uses a single hook. With crochet, you can create a wide variety of items such as blankets, scarves, hats, and even intricate lacework. It's a popular hobby enjoyed by many people around the world. The options are endless!
