                        The single crochet is one of the basic crochet stitches, and it's often one of the first stitches that beginners learn. Once you've created a foundation chain, you can start working single crochet stitches into it to build your fabric. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make a single crochet:
                        
                       <br> 1.Insert your hook: Take your crochet hook and insert it into the desired stitch of the foundation chain. The first stitch is usually the second chain from the hook, but it can vary depending on the pattern.
                       <br> 2.Yarn over: Once your hook is inserted, wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front, moving in a counter-clockwise direction.
                       <br> 3.Pull through: Draw the wrapped yarn through the stitch. Now, you should have two loops on your hook.
                       <br> 4.Yarn over and pull through both loops: Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through both loops on the hook. This completes one single crochet stitch.
                       <br> 5.Continue across the row: Repeat steps 1 to 4 for each stitch in the foundation chain until you reach the end of the row.
                       <br> 6.Turning chain: When you reach the end of the row, you'll need to turn your work to start the next row. To do this, chain one (or as many as required by the pattern) and turn your work.
                       <br> 7.Single crochet in each stitch: Insert your hook into the first stitch of the new row, yarn over, pull through the stitch, yarn over, and pull through both loops on the hook. Continue making single crochet stitches across the row.
                       <br> 8.Repeat: Repeat step 7 for each row, making a turning chain at the end of each row, until your project reaches the desired length.

                                The double crochet (abbreviated as "dc") is another fundamental crochet stitch and is taller than the single crochet. It's commonly used in various crochet projects and can create a more open and airy fabric. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make a double crochet:
                                
                               <br>1.Yarn over and insert your hook: Yarn over by wrapping the yarn from back to front around your hook, moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Then, insert your hook into the desired stitch of your foundation chain or previous row.
                               <br>2.Yarn over and pull through: Yarn over again and pull it through the stitch you inserted your hook into. Now, you should have three loops on your hook.
                               <br>3.Yarn over and pull through two loops: Yarn over once more and pull it through the first two loops on your hook. You should have two loops remaining on the hook.
                               <br>4.Yarn over and pull through the last two loops: Yarn over one final time and pull it through the remaining two loops on your hook. This completes one double crochet stitch.
                               <br>5.Continue across the row: Repeat steps 1 to 4 for each stitch in the foundation chain or the previous row until you reach the end.
                               <br>6.Turning chain: To start the next row, you'll need to create a turning chain. For double crochet, typically chain three at the end of the row and turn your work.
                               <br>7.Double crochet in each stitch: Starting in the second stitch from the hook (the first stitch is where you made the turning chain), yarn over, insert your hook, and work a double crochet following steps 2 to 4. Continue making double crochet stitches across the row.
                               <br>8.Repeat: Repeat step 7 for each row, making a turning chain of three at the end of each row, until your project reaches the desired length.
